"Hints & Tips",
"
<br/>
    At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.<br/><br/>
    When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, castles, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.<br/><br/>
    If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.<br/><br/>
    Always be on the lookout for nightvision. Two pairs are located in the Large Cache, and there are pairs scattered throughout cars. You can also purchase them from the gunstores. Nighttime without them SUCKS, and if you have them, you can conduct stealth raids on enemy bases under the cover of complete darkness.<br/><br/>
    When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.<br/><br/>
    The helicopter from the side mission spawns with no fuel, so do not make a mad dash for the chopper unless you are armed and plan to protect it, or have some fuel which can be found in the fuel truck, or in the palated barrels from the abandoned base.<br/>
    There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most side missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.<br/>

FAQ<br/>
Q. What am I supposed to do here?<br/>
A. See the above description<br/>
<br/>
Q. Where can I get a gun?<br/>
A. Weapons are found in one of three places, first in ammo caches that randomly spawn around the map inside and outside buildings, and second, in the gear section of the vehicles, which also randomly spawn around the map. The last place to find a gun would be at the gunshops located throughout the map. You can also find them on dead players whose bodies have not yet been looted.
<br/><br/>
Q. What are the circles on the map?<br/>
A. The circles represent town limits. If friendly soldiers are in a town, you can spawn there from the re-spawn menu; however if there is an enemy presence, you will not be able to spawn there.
<br/><br/>
Q. Why is it so dark, I cant see.<br/>
A. The server has a day/night cycle just like in the real world, and as such, night time is a factor in your survival. It is recommended that you find sources of light or Night Vision Goggles before the darkness sets in. You can find night vision goggles in vehicles, or you can purchase them at the gunshops.
<br/><br/>
Q. Is it ok for me to shoot my team mates?<br/>
A. If you are member of BLUFOR or OPFOR teams, then you are not allowed to shoot or steam items and vehicles from other players. If you play as Independent, you are free to engage anyone as well as team up with anyone you want.
<br/><br/>
Q. Whats with the teapots and big bags?<br/>
A. This game has a food and water system that you must stay on top of if you hope to survive. You can collect food and water from water barrels, food stands, or dead players bodies. Food and water will randomly spawn around the map. Other items that will randomly spawn are fuel cans for refueling vehicles, medkits for healing yourself, and repair kits for repairing vehicles. Each of these is a one-time-only use item.
<br/><br/>
Q. I saw someone breaking a rule, what do I do?<br/>
A. Simply go into global chat and get the attention of one of the admins or visit www.404games.co.uk/forum and make a report if the offence is serious.
